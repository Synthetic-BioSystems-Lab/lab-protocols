# Steps
1. Calculate the volume of DNA by dividing 500ng by the DNA concentration (500ng/DNA[ ])
2. Add 3ul of 10x buffer to the Eppendorf tube
3. Add 1ul of each restriction enzyme to the Eppendorf tube
4. Add the calculated DNA volume to the Eppendorf tube
5. Fill Eppendorf tube with distilled water to bring it to a total volume of 30ul
6. Mix gently by pipetting
7. Incubated at 37°C for 1-2 hours
