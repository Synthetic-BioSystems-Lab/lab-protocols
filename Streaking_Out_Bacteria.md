- Petri dish with LB agar and antibiotic
- Inoculating loops
- Bunsen burner

Steps:
1. Light bunsen burner
2. Open and label petri dishes
3. Select colonie with inoculation loop
4. Streak out bacteria
5. Start with streaking out a wide area at the top of the petri dish
6. Turn petri dish 90° and draw four straight lines at "the new" top from your initial deposit across the dish
7. Turn petri dish 90 and draw three lines at top starting from the four lines drawn before
8. Turn petri dish 90 and draw two lines at top starting from the three lines drawn before
9. Finish by drawing a squiggly line to the center of the petri dish
10. Incubate petri dish at 37C
