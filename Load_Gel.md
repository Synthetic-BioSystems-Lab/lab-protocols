# Steps
1. Add 1 ul of loading buffer per 5 ul of sample
2. Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit)
3. Fill gel box with 1xTAE until the gel is covered
4. Load 3ul of DNA 0x1kb+ ladder to the first well
5. Carefully load 5ul of your samples into the additional wells of the gel
6. Run the gel at 90 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel. A typical run time is about 45 min
7. Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel box
8. Using any device that has UV light, visualize your DNA fragments. The fragments of DNA are usually referred to as ‘bands’ due to their appearance on the gel
